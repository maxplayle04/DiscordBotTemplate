## DiscordBotTemplate
This project is designed to help people start using the Discord.NET API Wrapper Library. Out of the box (or clone, if you like) it will run a fully functional bot, which you are welcome to expand upon if you wish.

### Contribution
Contributions are very much welcome, just submit a Pull Request and shoot me a message on [Discord](https://maxplayledev.org/discord) otherwise I probably won't notice you've sent one in!

### Donations
Donations are always welcome, although never necessary! If you'd like to [buy me a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/maxplayle) you are very much welcome to.

### Work in progress!
This project is very much a work in progress. I'd like to continue adding things to it. Please do feel free to join in! If you'd like to become an official contributor, come say hello on my Discord Server!
